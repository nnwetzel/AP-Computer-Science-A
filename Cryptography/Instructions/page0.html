<BR>In lecture, the Udacity folks talk about casting as converting one item into another.  If you want to force a double to act as an int, you put the type in parentheses in front.  Here's an example.
<BR>
<BR>double lemonMeringuePie = 3.141519;
<BR>int newPie = (int) lemonMeringuePie;  // But...newPie is just 3.  The decimal part is dropped.
