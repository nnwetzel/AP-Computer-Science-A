Checkpoint 0

The main class, FracCalc will have a scanner. It will take input from the user and send it to the FracCalc class to be solved, and then be printed. If "quit" is
entered, then the program will stop.

The Fraction class will have a constructor that sets the first fraction entered by the user as the initial result, in terms of numerator and denominator variables.
It will also use the reduce method to set the initial value to it's simplest improper fraction form.

The Fraction class will have a method that determines the greatest common denominator of a fraction, which is neccessary when reducing a fraction to its simplest
form.

The Fraction class will have a method that reduces the fraction to its simplest form.
