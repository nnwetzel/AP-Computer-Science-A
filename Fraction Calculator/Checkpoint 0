Checkpoint 0

The main class, FracCalc will have a scanner. It will take input from the user and send it to the FracCalc class to be solved, and then be printed. If "quit" is
entered, then the program will stop.

The Fraction class will have a constructor that sets the first fraction entered by the user as the initial result, in terms of numerator and denominator variables.
It will also use the reduce method to set the initial value to its simplest improper fraction form. Depending on the arithmetic symbol ("+", "-", "*", "/") either
the add, subtract, multiply, or divide method will be called. There will also be getters to obtain the value of the changed variable.
The GCD method will determine the greatest common denominator of a fraction (which is neccesary when reducing a fraction to its simplest form) and will return the
result.
The reduction method will reduce the fraction to its simplest improper fraction form and will return the result.
The add method will add the second fraction with the first fraction and will return the result.
The subtract method will subtract the second fraction from the first fraction and will return the result.
The multiply method will multiply the second fraction with the first fraction and will return the result.
The divide method will divide the second fraction with the first fraction and will return the result.
The format method will returns a string after formatting the changed numerator and denominator.
