Magpie Chatbot Lab

Activity 1

I used the Chomsky chatbot for this activity.

1. When asked "Where did you come from?" the chatbot always responses with "I come from England." and when asked "asdfghjkl;" it responds with "That doesn't make
any sense.
2. A chatbot might respond to keywords such as "time" with the actual time or something it doesn't understand like "qwertyuiop" with "Excuse me?"


Activity 2

Keyword: weather          | Response: The weather is always just right where I am.
Keyword: sad, depressed   | Response: I am sorry to hear that.
Keyword: hungry, famished | Response: You should eat something!

If you were to enter "My mother has a dog but no cat", the reply method would priortize the statement that comes first, so the response would be "Why so negative?".
In order to priortize responses, the statement must go in a certain order.

1. When a statement contains a keyword such as "no" in "know" it responds the same way as if it was just "no". The problem with the response is that it probably
won't make sense and isn't what is intended.


Activity 3

If the substring does not occur in the string it returns -1.

findKeyword("She's my sister", "sister", 0");
Iteration: 1 | psn: 9  | before: ' ' | after: ' '

findKeyword("My brother Tom is helpful", "brother", 0);
Iteration: 1 | psn: 0  | before: ' ' | after: ' '

findKeyword("I can't catch wild cats.", "cat" 0)l
Iteration: 2 | psn: 8  | before: ' ' | after: 'c'
Iteration: 3 | psn: 19 | before: ' ' | after: 's'

findKeyword("I know nothing about snow plows.", "no", 0);
Iteration: 1 | psn: 3  | before: 'k' | after: 'w'
Iteration: 2 | psn: 7  | before: ' ' | after: 't'
Iteration: 3 | psn: 22 | before: 's' | after: 'w'

Activity 4

This structure does not work well with the past-tense, for example the response to "I forgot you" is "Why do you forgot me?"


Activity 5

I can't think of a better way to get the random responses, however code refactoring isn't essential here because the outcome is the same nevertheless.
